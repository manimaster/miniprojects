/*
Problem Statement:
Develop a sentiment analysis tool that can classify tweets or reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories. 
The solution should be based on a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset of tweets/reviews.

Note: This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you'd use a much larger dataset and possibly more advanced models.
